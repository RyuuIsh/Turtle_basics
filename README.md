# Turtle_basics
A fun and interactive project demonstrating the basics of Python's turtle graphics library. This project showcases various shapes, patterns, and designs, making use of loops, colors, and randomization.

## Features
1. Draw Shapes:
- Creates simple shapes like squares and polygons with vibrant colors.
2. Dashed Lines:
- Demonstrates how to draw dashed lines using the penup() and pendown() methods.
3. Multiple Polygons:
- Draws polygons ranging from triangles to decagons, each with a unique color.
4. Random Walk:
- Simulates a random walk with changing colors, directions, and line thickness.
5. Spirograph Art:
- Generates intricate spirograph designs with random colors and adjustable patterns.
6. Random Colors:
- Incorporates RGB color generation for dynamic and unique visual effects.

## How it works
1. Basic Shapes:
- Draws a square using a loop and then adds more complex shapes like polygons.
2. Dashed Lines:
- Creates a dashed effect by alternating between drawing and lifting the pen.
3. Polygons:
- Loops through a predefined list of shapes and colors to draw polygons.
4. Random Walk:
- Moves the turtle in random directions while changing its color and thickness.
5. Spirograph:
- Draws circular patterns by rotating the turtle slightly after each circle.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (comes pre-installed with Python)

## Highlights
- Interactive and Fun: Learn turtle graphics through visually appealing examples.
- Customizable: Easily modify the shapes, colors, or patterns to create your unique designs.
- Great for Beginners: A perfect introduction to Python graphics programming.
